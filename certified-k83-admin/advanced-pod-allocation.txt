Scheduling
- Process of assigning Pods to Nodes so kubelets can run them

Scheduler
- Control plane component that handles scheduling

nodeSelector
- You can configure a nodeSelector for your Pods to limit which Node(s) the Pod can be
  scheduled on

nodeName
- You can bypass scheduling and assign a Pod to a specific Node by name using nodeName

CMDS:

- Label a node
  # kubectl label nodes k8s-worker2 external-auth-services=true

---

DaemonSets
- Automatically runs a copy of a pod on each node
- They will also run a copy of the pod on new nodes as they are added to the cluster

CMDS:

- Get daemonset
  # kubectl get daemonset

---

Static Pod
- a pod managed directly by kubelet on a node, not by k8s API server. They can run even
  if there is no k8s API present.
- Kubelet automatically creates static pods from yaml manifest files located in the
  manifest path on the node.

Mirror Pods
- kubelet will create a mirror pod for each static pod. Mirror pods allow you to see the
  status of static pod via the k8s API, but you cannot change or manage them via the API
